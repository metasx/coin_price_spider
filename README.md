## Quick Start Guide

For developers eager to hit the ground running with the CoinMarketCap API here are 3 quick steps to make your first call with the API.

#### 1.Sign up for a free Developer Portal account. You can sign up for one of our two API environments:
* sandbox.coinmarketcap.com - This testing sandbox has free access to all endpoints and all subscription plans to test with a snapshot of our market data.
* pro.coinmarketcap.com - This is our live production environment with the latest market data. Select the free Basic plan if it meets your needs or upgrade to a paid tier.


#### 2.Copy your API Key.
 Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account dashboard. Copy your API from the API Key box in the top left panel.
 
#### 3.Make a test call using your key. 
You may use the code examples provided below to make a test call with your programming language of choice. This example fetches all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD.

Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own and use API domain sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com if testing with our sandbox.coinmarketcap.com environment.

#### 4.Implement your application. 
Now that you've confirmed your API Key is working, get familiar with the API by reading the rest of this API Reference and commence building your application!
